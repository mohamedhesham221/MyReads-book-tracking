## My process

I created the app from scratch with `create-react-app` and i divided the app to components and two views and each view have specific components functionality, the app communicate with a Backend Server from Udacity for book information and long term storage.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Backend Server

The provided file `BooksAPI.js` contains following methods to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- `getAll()` for getting all your books.
- `update()` for updating shelf.
- `search()` for searching books while typing in input field.
- `get()` for getting book details

## Installation

Clone the repository, and install dependencies using NPM and start local host

### Important

The backend API is built by Udacity and only a fixed set of search terms are supported. Supported search terms can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](https://github.com/THEPEACEMAKER/myReads-book-tracking-app/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md)That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the API.
